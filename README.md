## Reflection

### The Good
I did not expect to enjoy using AI tools this much. I can honestly say that using these tools, I had the most fun programming that I have had in 10 years. It does all the dirty work while you can think about what to do next. I also can't stress enough how cool it is that you can send a prompt, then get distracted by something else, but that prompt is still working. It also leaves a breadcrumb trail for you to remember where you were. I don't want to be too gung-ho about these tools, but I think they are actually a really good accessibility tool for people with executive function, memory, and attention issues. 

### The Bad
I felt myself getting into the loop of prompting for every error without taking a second to look at the error message and solve it myself. I think this is exactly why these tools are so dangerous for beginners. You need a certain amount of discipline to use these tools well without atrophying your skills. 

### Some notes about the website
- The banner picture is intentional
- The interactive feature is the contact form, it is set up using FormSubmit and sends an email to my personal email.
