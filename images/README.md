This `images/` folder contains placeholder images for the site. Replace these files with your own images (keeping the same filenames or updating references in HTML/CSS).

Files added:
- `logo.png` — small logo placeholder.
- `hero.jpg` — wide hero/banner placeholder.
- `project1.svg` — project thumbnail placeholder.
- `project2.svg` — project thumbnail placeholder.
- `profile.png` — profile/avatar placeholder.

Usage:
- Reference these images from your HTML/CSS using the relative path `images/<filename>`.
- To replace an image, overwrite the file with the same filename and the site will pick it up.
- If you prefer raster images, replace the `.svg` files with `.png` or `.jpg` and update HTML/CSS accordingly.
